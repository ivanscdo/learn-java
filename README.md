# learn-java

## Tutorial
Currently following the [official Oracle tutorials.](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/index.html)

## JDK

Installed Java SE Development Kit 8 (JDK 8), which can be [found here.](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

## IDE
I installed [netbeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/nb100/nb100.html) but, at least for now while I mainly work on practice problems from the turotial and online challenges, I found it much easier to work with VIM (not confident enough to jump into emacs just yet).

## Style Guide
Following the [Google Java Style Guide.](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)

## Current Contribution
[Pascal's Triangle](https://github.com/ivanscdo/learn-java/blob/master/00-sandbox/04-pascals-triangle/PascalsTriangle.java).

This was definitely the most challenging problem yet. It forced me to learn Collections (ArrayLists) and 2D ArrayLists.
